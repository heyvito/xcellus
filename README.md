# Xcellus

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xcellus.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xcellus)

**Xcellus** is an ugly XLSX generator. It leverages a native extension to create
XLSX files. It is said to be an 'ugly' generator because it lacks all styling
mechanisms to make your XLSX pretty (such as fonts, borders, and the likes).

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Xcellus is targeted for Linux and macOS (both amd64). It won't work on other architectures and support for them is not planned.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xcellus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xcellus

## Usage

Xcellus transforms a list of hashes (acting as worksheets) into a XLSX workbook:

```ruby
require 'xcellus'
io = Xcellus.transform [
  {
    title: 'Brian\'s Worksheet',
    headers: [:Artist, :Track, :Playcount],
    rows: [
        ['Metallica',               'Hero of the Day',      242],
        ['Metallica',               'The Shortest Straw',   186],
        ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'My God Is the Sun',    276],
        ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'I Sat by the Ocean',   270],
        ['Gorillaz',                'On Melancholy Hill',   203],
        ['Gorillaz',                'Kids With Guns',       184],
    ]
  }
]
# => #<StringIO:0x000000000245cc78>

File.open('BrianosMusic.xlsx', 'wb') do |f|
  f.write(io.string)
end
# => 6377
```

It also can modify files:

```ruby
require 'xcellus'
Xcellus.with 'BrianosMusic.xlsx' do |xls|
  # Let's find and replace 'I Sat by the Ocean' with something else:
  row_index = xls.find_in_column 'Brian\'s Worksheet', 1, 'I Sat by the Ocean'
  # row_index == 4
  xls.replace_row 'Brian\'s Worksheet', row_index, [nil, 'The Evil has Landed']
  # Now, the row ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'I Sat by the Ocean',   270],
  # will be composed by ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'The Evil has Landed',   270],
  # Let's also add a new row
  xls.append [
    { title: 'Brian\'s Worksheet', rows: [['Queen', 'Spread Your Wings', 27]] }
  ]
  # Now, Brian's Worksheet has the following data:
  # | Artist                  | Track               | Playcount |
  # | Metallica               | Hero of the Day     | 242       |
  # | Metallica               | The Shortest Straw  | 186       |
  # | Queens of the Stone Age | My God Is the Sun   | 276       |
  # | Queens of the Stone Age | The Evil has Landed | 270       |
  # | Gorillaz                | On Melancholy Hill  | 203       |
  # | Gorillaz                | Kids With Guns      | 184       |
  # | Queen                   | Spread Your Wings   | 27        |
  # And we can save a copy:
  xls.save('Copy of BrianosMusic.xlsx')
end
# Here, all resources are freed.
```
