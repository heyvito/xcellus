# Xcellus

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xcellus.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xcellus)

**Xcellus** is an ugly XLSX generator. It leverages a native extension to create
XLSX files. It is said to be an 'ugly' generator because it lacks all styling
mechanisms to make your XLSX pretty (such as fonts, borders, and the likes).

## Installation

> **WARNING**: Xcellus is targeted for Linux and macOS (both amd64). It won't work on other architectures and support for them is not planned.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'xcellus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xcellus

## Usage

Xcellus transforms a list of hashes (acting as worksheets) into a XLSX workbook:

```ruby
require 'xcellus'
io = Xcellus.transform [
  {
    title: 'Brian\'s Worksheet',
    headers: [:Artist, :Track, :Playcount],
    rows: [
        ['Metallica',               'Hero of the Day',      242],
        ['Metallica',               'The Shortest Straw',   186],
        ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'My God Is the Sun',    276],
        ['Queens of the Stone Age', 'I Sat by the Ocean',   270],
        ['Gorillaz',                'On Melancholy Hill',   203],
        ['Gorillaz',                'Kids With Guns',       184],
    ]
  }
]
# => #<StringIO:0x000000000245cc78>

File.open('BrianosMusic.xlsx', 'wb') do |f|
  f.write(io.string)
end
# => 6377
```
